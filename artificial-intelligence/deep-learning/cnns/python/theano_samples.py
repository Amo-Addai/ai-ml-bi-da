'''
Explanation:

We use Lasagne, a lightweight library to build and train neural networks in Theano.
We define the model architecture using convolutional layers, max pooling layers, fully connected layers, and dropout layers.
We specify the input variables for the model.
We define the loss function (categorical cross-entropy) and the update rule (Adam optimizer).
We compile functions for training and testing the model.
Finally, we print the summary of the model architecture.
This model architecture is similar to the previous one but implemented using Theano instead of Keras. It's suitable for image classification tasks and includes techniques like dropout to prevent overfitting.

'''
Explanation:

Batch Size: The number of samples propagated through the network at once. A batch size of 64 means that 64 samples will be processed in each training iteration.
Number of Epochs: The number of times the entire dataset is passed through the network. Here, we iterate over 10 epochs.
Training Loop: We iterate over epochs and batches, training the model on each batch of training data.
Test Data Evaluation: After training, we evaluate the model's performance on the test data to assess its generalization ability.

# Assuming X_train, y_train, X_test, and y_test are provided
# Let's assume X_train and X_test are numpy arrays of shape (num_samples, channels, height, width)

'''
Explanation of parameters:

X_train and y_train: Training data and labels.
X_test and y_test: Test data and labels.
batch_size: Number of samples per gradient update. It defines the number of samples that will be propagated through the network before updating the model's parameters.
num_epochs: Number of epochs to train the model.
updates: The updates computed by the optimizer during training.
categorical_crossentropy: The loss function used to evaluate the model's performance on the test data.
In both cases, the test data serves as an independent dataset to evaluate the model's performance after training. It helps to ensure that the model generalizes well to unseen data. The test loss and accuracy are important metrics to assess the model's effectiveness in making predictions on new, unseen data.
