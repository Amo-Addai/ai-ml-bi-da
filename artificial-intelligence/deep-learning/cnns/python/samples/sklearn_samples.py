'''
Scikit-learn doesn't natively support deep learning models like Keras or TensorFlow. 
But it can be used for building a deep learning model by leveraging its MLPClassifier, which is a multi-layer perceptron classifier. 
While these aren't traditional CNN models, we can create deep neural networks with multiple layers.

Explanation of parameters:

hidden_layer_sizes: Tuple representing the number of neurons in each hidden layer.
activation: Activation function for the hidden layers. Common choices include 'relu', 'tanh', and 'logistic'.
solver: Optimization algorithm. Options include 'adam', 'sgd' (stochastic gradient descent), and 'lbfgs' (limited-memory BFGS).
alpha: L2 penalty (regularization term) parameter.
batch_size: Number of samples per batch. 'auto' uses min(200, n_samples).
learning_rate: Learning rate schedule for weight updates. Options include 'constant', 'invscaling', and 'adaptive'.
max_iter: Maximum number of iterations.
shuffle: Whether to shuffle training data in each iteration.
random_state: Random seed for reproducibility.
momentum: Momentum for gradient descent update. Only used when solver='sgd'.
early_stopping: Whether to use early stopping to terminate training when validation score is not improving.
validation_fraction: Fraction of training data to set aside as validation set for early stopping.
beta_1, beta_2, epsilon: Parameters for the Adam optimization algorithm.
n_iter_no_change: Maximum number of iterations with no improvement before terminating training when early_stopping is enabled

'''
Explanation:

We use scikit-learn's MLPClassifier to create a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) model with multiple dense layers.
Each dense layer contributes to the model's ability to learn complex patterns in the data.
We use ReLU activation for the hidden layers, which introduces non-linearity and helps the model learn more complex representations.
We use softmax activation in the output layer to obtain probability scores for each class.
We include dropout layers by setting the alpha parameter, which adds regularization to prevent overfitting.
We use StandardScaler to standardize the input features.
We fit the model to the training data and evaluate its performance on the test data using accuracy score.
