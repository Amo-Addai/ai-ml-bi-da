'''
Since scikit-learn's MLPRegressor class does not support recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or LSTM-based models, we cannot directly implement a 10-layer sequential RNN model as described in your query using only scikit-learn.
However, we can implement a 10-layer feedforward neural network (multi-layer perceptron) using scikit-learn's MLPRegressor. 
This will not be an RNN or LSTM-based model, but it will demonstrate how to create a deep neural network with multiple layers using scikit-learn.

Explanation:

MLPRegressor: This class implements a multi-layer perceptron regressor. It allows us to create a neural network with multiple hidden layers.

Hidden Layer Sizes: The hidden_layer_sizes parameter specifies the number of neurons in each hidden layer. In this example, we have 10 hidden layers, each with 64 neurons.

Activation Function: The activation parameter specifies the activation function used in each neuron. Here, we use the Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activation function, which is commonly used in deep neural networks.

Solver: The solver parameter specifies the optimization algorithm used to train the neural network. Here, we use the Adam optimizer.

Regularization: The alpha parameter specifies the L2 regularization parameter. Regularization helps prevent overfitting by penalizing large weights.

Batch Size: The batch_size parameter specifies the number of samples per mini-batch during training. It affects the speed and stability of training.

Learning Rate: The learning_rate and learning_rate_init parameters control the learning rate of the optimization algorithm. In this example, we use a constant learning rate.

Maximum Iterations: The max_iter parameter specifies the maximum number of iterations (epochs) for training.

Tolerance: The tol parameter specifies the tolerance for optimization. Training stops when the improvement is less than this value.

Random State: The random_state parameter sets the random seed for reproducibility.

This example demonstrates how to build a deep neural network with 10 hidden layers using scikit-learn's MLPRegressor. However, please note that this is not an RNN or LSTM-based model as requested in your query.
